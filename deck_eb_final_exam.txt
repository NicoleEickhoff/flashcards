due to bias.
a. a decision tree that only goes one node deep
b. using a phonebook to select participants of a survey
c. small sample size

Answer: using a phonebook to select participants of a survey

Note:

###Question: Give an example of a situation where a model might have high error
due to variance.
a. using a phonebook to select participants of a survey
b. an unpruned decision tree
c. a pruned decision tree

Answer: an unpruned decision tree

Note:

###Question: Explain the bias-variance trade-off as if your boss were five.
a. when you get more bias, you often have less variance.
b. simpler models are more biased because they group data into fewer categories.
c. more complex models are more biased because they overfit.

Answer: simpler models are more biased because they group data into fewer categories.

Note:

###Question: In what circumstances is regularization used?
a. in circumstances with dependent variables

c. in circumstances where variables cannot be easily compared

Answer: in circumstances with lots of variables

Note:

###Question: What is Bayes' Theorem?

Answer: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Note:

###Question: How can MapReduce be used to average many numbers?

Answer: Mapper sends all values to key. Reducer sums values. Counter counts values. Divide sum by count.

Note:

###Question: What is the formula for sensitivity (in a confusion matrix)?

Answer: TP/TP+FN

Note:

###Question: What is the formula for specificity (in a confusion matrix)?

Answer:TN/TN+FP

Note:

###Question: What is the formula for accuracy (in a confusion matrix)?

Answer: TP+TN/Total

Note:

###Question: What is the formula for precision (in a confusion matrix)?

Answer: TP/TP+FP

Note:

###Question: How is the ROC curve generated?


Answer: It is a plot of the true positive rate against the true negative rate.

Note:

###Question: What is the difference between ROC and AUC ROC?

Answer: ROC is a range, while AUC ROC is a single number (the area under the curve).

###Question: Linear Regression: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R, S, finds linear relationships, can be used to predict linear relationships, doesn't work for nonlinear data.

Note:

###Question: Logistic Regression: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: C, S, a regression model where the dependent variable is categorical, estimates probability of class being yes, data must truly be binary.

Note:

###Question: k-Nearest Neighbors: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R&C, S, non-parametric method used to identify Ys based on distance, simple way to predict without prior knowledge of the data, it is lazy (uses all the data) and therefore expensive

Note:

###Question: Decision Trees: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R&C, S, organizes data along branches and nodes to maximize purity of information, easy to see and understand, prone to overfitting

Note:

###Question: SVMs: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R&C, S, the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples, it finds a line passing as far as possible from all points, black box

Note:

###Question: PCR: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R, U, is based on PCA, reduces dimensionality, makes your variables independent, black box

Note:

###Question: k-Means Clustering: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: C, U, aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, works well with spherical clusters, inconsistent repeatability

Note:

###Question: Hierarchical Clustering: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: C, U, bottom-up or top-down, splits a single cluster into minis or pairs minis together into larger clusters, greedy algorithm- can fail to reach global optimum

Note:

###Question: DBSCAN: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: C, U, finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them, good for data which contains clusters of similar density, quality depends on distance measurement used

Note:

###Question: Neural Networks: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R&C, S&U, contains an input, hidden layer, output and weights, you update weights based on error, processor intensive and can be hard to interpret

Note:

###Question: Naive Bayes: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: C, S, requires only a small sample to predict classes, assumes independence of variables, typically not as good as random forests

Note:

###Question: ARIMA: R/C, S/U, Unique, Explain, Pitfalls

Answer: R, S, autoregressive integrated moving average, uses a "differencing step" to eliminate non-stationarity and forecast future events, would not be useful for non-time data
